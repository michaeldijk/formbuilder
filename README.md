# Form builder
The idea of the form-builder is to create a uniform way, like i.e. Bootstrap, for creating web-forms, their styling, and, applying settings to them, using a customer CSS file.

## Current stage / version
Currently this is an idea, being brought to life by Michael Dijk. More information to follow in the readme here, and, progression in the github deployment pages.
